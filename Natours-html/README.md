| Sass support                 | Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) into CSS with ease, bringing support for variables, mixins and more (Run `gulp` for project compiling). In our WSK we follow Sass [guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).                                                                                                                |
| Performance optimization     | Minify and concatenate JavaScript, CSS, HTML and images to help keep your pages lean (Run `npm run build` to create an optimised version of your project to `production` folder).                                                                                                                                                            |
| Code Linting                 | JavaScript code linting is done using [esLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-eslint) - a linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript (used airbnb-base rules https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base). HTML code hinting is done using [HtmlHint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-htmlhint). |
| ES2015(ES6) Support          | Optional ES2015 support .You can use all kind of ES6 features here. ES2015 source code will be automatically transpiled to ES5 for wide browser support.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Built-in HTTP Server         | A built-in server for previewing your site locally while you develop and iterate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Live Browser Reloading       | Reload the browser in real-time anytime an edit is made without the need for an extension (Run `npm start` and edit your files).                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Cross-device Synchronization | Synchronize clicks, scrolls, forms and live-reload across multiple devices as you edit your project. Powered by [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) (Run `npm start` and open up the IP provided on other devices on your network).                                                                                                         |

## Overview

Natours-html is an opinionated boilerplate for web development. Tools for building a great experience across many devices. A solid starting point for both professionals and newcomers to the industry.

## Browser Support

At present, I officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

-   Chrome
-   Edge
-   Firefox
-   Safari
-   Internet Explorer

This is not to say that Natours-html cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that my focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## Prerequisites

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`.
Node should respond with a version at or above 4.0.x.
If you need to install Node, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

### [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`.
If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.9.x.
If you need to install/upgrade Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

_This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to [configure your system](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install packages globally without administrative privileges._

**In this project I use Gulp version 4.0**

### Local dependencies

Next, install the local dependencies Natours-html requires:

```sh
$ npm install
```

or

```sh
$ npm i
```

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the Natours-html.

You may also want to get used to some of the [commands](#commands) available.

## Commands

There are many commands available to help you build and test sites. Here are a few highlights to get started with.

### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

## Build & Optimize

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment.
This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.
Also, a [browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
script will be automatically generated, which will take care of precaching your sites' resources.

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Serve the Fully Built & Optimized Site

```sh
$ npm run build
```

`npm run build` task creates the `build/` folder in the root of the project with **build files only**. It will **help you** to **create clear** instances of code for the **production** or **further implementation**.

```

## Troubleshooting

If you find yourself running into issues during installation or running the tools, open an issue. I would be happy to discuss how they can be solved.
